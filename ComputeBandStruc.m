%COMPUTEBANDSTRUC Compute 2-d band structure of optical lattice 
%   Using the potential output by the general lattice for N beams code, I
%   will use this program to compute the electronic band structure of the
%   system. Note, this needs to be in the same directory (or path) as the
%   general lattice complex function given that the latter needs to be
%   called to generate the potential (specifically the underlying
%   sinusoidal representation)

%% generate the lattice potential
%using the 6 cosine components of the lattice potential generated as output
%from Peter's code.
A = [1,1,0.6,0.5];
ph_deg = [0, 0, 90, -70];
th_deg = [0,90,180,270];
pol_deg = [0,0,0,0];
plots = 0; %boolean to turn plots on or off
[waveAmplitudes,deltaKsUnitless,deltaPhis,maxAmp]=GeneralLatticeComplexRepWithComponents(A,ph_deg,th_deg,pol_deg,plots);
%since these are effectively indices (in fourier space), we need these to
%be rounded to integers. They pretty much already are to MATLAB precision
deltaKsUnitless = round(deltaKsUnitless);
potentialDepth = 5; %in Er!!
waveAmplitudes = waveAmplitudes.*(potentialDepth./maxAmp);
%% Find the Complex Exponential Coefficients
%Effectively I just want the coefficients of the complex fourier series

%BIG varible here. This is the size of the plane wave basis. I.E. the
%fourier coefficients will be included up to +- max_m. This means that the
%tensor size will be 2*(max_m)+1. Note that this MUST be large enough to
%include the highest frequency cosine that will be part of the potential.
%This is crucial since you could theoretically cut the matrix off at any
%point where you would be happy with the accuracy in finding the
%eigenvalues and vectors, but the KVectors could be arbitrarily large. In
%this case they are not (<=2), but in principle they could be quite large.
max_m = 5;
mLength = 2*max_m + 1;
Vcoeff = zeros(mLength,mLength);
for jj = 1:6
    xKcomp = deltaKsUnitless(jj,1);
    yKcomp = deltaKsUnitless(jj,2);
    %I am making the index xKcomp+(max_m+1)because x/y K components could
    %be negative. Therefore, I want to make sure that the 'center' of the
    %matrix corresponds to the (0,0) coefficient. This is also related to
    %my above comment, since if the basis is too small, then these
    %arguments could be negative and matlab will complain :(
    Vcoeff(xKcomp+(max_m+1),yKcomp+(max_m+1)) = Vcoeff(xKcomp+(max_m+1),yKcomp+(max_m+1)) + waveAmplitudes(jj).*(exp(-1i*deltaPhis(jj)))./2;
    Vcoeff(-xKcomp+(max_m+1),-yKcomp+(max_m+1)) = Vcoeff(-xKcomp+(max_m+1),-yKcomp+(max_m+1)) + waveAmplitudes(jj).*(exp(1i*deltaPhis(jj)))./2;
